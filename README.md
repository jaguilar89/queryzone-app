# Phase 4 Project
This is my Phase 4 Project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering program. It is a simple full stack question and answer site running with a React frontend and a Rails backend. A user can create a secure account to log in, then they can view a list of randomly generated seeded data in the form of questions and post comments(answers) on them. The users comments may also be edited and/or deleted.
